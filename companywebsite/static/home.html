            Cosmetics are constituted mixtures of chemical compounds derived from either natural sources, or synthetically created ones.[1] 
            Cosmetics have various purposes. Those designed for personal care and skin care can be used to cleanse or protect the body or skin.
             Cosmetics designed to enhance one's appearance (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes),
              add color to a person's face and can be used to change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature or object.
               Cosmetics can also be designed to add fragrance to the body.

            Cosmetics can also be designed to add fragrance to the body.cosmetics trade is one of the
            most active in the world. There are many advantages in using nanoparticles, the main 
            advantages of which are the delivery of interest active cosmetic ingredients into the
            skin, greater stability, lower quantities and minor toxicological mechanisms.
            Nanotechnology has high efficiency in cosmetics. Materials on the nanometre scale have
            a high surface area and consequently have an enhanced effect. In many cases,
            nanotechnology in cosmetics occurs in the form of nanoparticles, which can penetrate
            more deeply into the skin, as they go beyond more epithelial layers, enhancing
            hydrating, antiaging and protective effects (Carrouel et al., 2020). An exciting 
            way to apply nanotechnology in cosmetics is the use of nanoencapsulated materials
